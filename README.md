## Description

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio. It
is a Single Page Application (SPA) website designed and developed to
showcase my front-end web development skills, my professional experience
(including development and marketing), and a selection of projects I
have worked on.

The main goal is to serve as an interactive digital business card for
potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my
professional profile.

## Live Demo

## Main Features

- Responsive Design: Fully adaptable to different screen sizes (mobile,
  tablet, desktop) using Media Queries.
- Light/Dark Theme: Includes a toggle to switch between light and dark
  themes. User preference is saved in localStorage for future visits.
- Smooth Navigation: Single-page experience with smooth scrolling that
  guides the user through different sections: Profile, About Me,
  Experience, Projects, and Contact.
- Animated Background: A subtle particle animation in the profile
  section (#profile) created with HTML Canvas and JavaScript.
- Project Carousel: The projects section is presented as an interactive
  carousel (slider) implemented with the Swiper.js library, allowing
  easy Browse through different works.
- Relevant Links: Direct access to my LinkedIn profile, GitHub
  repository, and the option to download my updated CV in PDF format.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For the semantic structure of the content.
- CSS3: For visual styles, layout (Flexbox/Grid), CSS variables
  (theming), animations, and responsive design (Media Queries).
- JavaScript (ES6+): For interactivity, DOM manipulation (hamburger
  menu, theme switching), Canvas animation, and initializing/controlling
  the project carousel.
- Swiper.js: JavaScript library used to create the carousel/slider in
  the projects section.
- SVG: For icons used in the interface, ensuring scalability and visual
  quality.
